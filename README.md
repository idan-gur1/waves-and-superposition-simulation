# Sin Waves and Superposition Simulation

Python-based physics simulation that allows you to explore sin waves and the concept of wave superposition. The simulation provides a visual representation of sin waves, and their properties, and demonstrates the phenomenon of wave superposition, where multiple waves combine to form a resultant wave.

**Requirements:** To run the simulation, you need to have the Pygame and Matplotlib libraries installed. You can install them using the following commands:

```
pip install pygame
pip install matplotlib
```

**Running the Simulation:** To execute the simulation, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:

```
python waves_and_superposition_simulation.py
```

Make sure you have Python installed on your system before running the above command.

**Note:** Only two waves were shown in the demo, in the full simulation there could be an indefinite amount of waves.
